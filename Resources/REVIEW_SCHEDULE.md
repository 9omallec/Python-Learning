# Spaced Repetition Review Schedule

**Science-backed review intervals for maximum retention**

---

## 🧠 The Science Behind This Schedule

**Research shows:**
- We forget **70% of new information within 24 hours**
- Reviewing at optimal intervals = **30-50% better retention**
- The best intervals: **Day 1, Day 7, Day 16, Day 35**

**How it works:**
- You review RIGHT BEFORE you would forget
- Each review strengthens the neural pathway
- Spacing creates long-term memory (cramming creates short-term)

## 📅 Your 35-Day Review System

### **The Pattern:**

```
Day 1  ─────→ Learn & Build
Day 2  ─────→ Review (24-hour recall)
Day 8  ─────→ Review (7-day recall)
Day 17 ─────→ Review (16-day recall)
Day 36 ─────→ Review (35-day recall)
```

### **What to Do at Each Review:**

**Day 1: Initial Learning**
- Build a project using new concept
- Make it work (doesn't need to be perfect)
- Save it with date: `2025-12-08_project_name.py`

**Day 2: 24-Hour Review (5-10 min)**
- Open yesterday's project
- Explain what each line does (out loud!)
- Add one small feature
- Fix anything that bugs you

**Day 8: 7-Day Review (10-15 min)**
- WITHOUT opening old project, try to rebuild core functionality
- Get stuck? That's normal! Look up what you need
- Compare to original - what did you forget?
- Build similar project using same concept

**Day 17: 16-Day Review (15-20 min)**
- Use this concept in a NEW, more complex project
- Combine with other concepts you've learned
- Challenge: Make it do something you haven't tried before

**Day 36: 35-Day Review (5 min)**
- Explain the concept to someone (or write it out)
- Glance at old projects using this concept
- Can you still remember how they work?
- This is your "long-term memory check"

## 📊 Tracking Your Reviews

### **Simple Tracking Method:**

Create file: `review_tracker.txt`

```
=== CONCEPT: If/Else Statements ===
Day 1 (12/08):  Built password_validator.py ✓
Day 2 (12/09):  Added strength checker ✓
Day 8 (12/15):  Built age_verifier.py ✓
Day 17 (12/24): Built game with if/else + loops ✓
Day 36 (01/12): Explained concept, reviewed projects ✓

=== CONCEPT: Loops ===
Day 1 (12/10):  Built number_guesser.py ✓
Day 2 (12/11):  Added attempts counter ✓
Day 8 (12/17):  [pending]
Day 17 (12/26): [pending]
Day 36 (01/14): [pending]
```

### **Calendar Integration:**

Use your calendar app to set reminders:

**When you learn something new:**
1. Create calendar event: "Review [Concept]"
2. Set to repeat: +1 day, +7 days, +16 days, +35 days
3. When reminder pops up: spend 5-15 min reviewing

## ⚡ Quick Review Techniques

### **Active Recall Methods:**

**Level 1: Flash Rebuild (5 min)**
- Close all files
- Open blank file
- Rebuild core functionality from memory
- Check original only when truly stuck

**Level 2: Feature Addition (10 min)**
- Open old project
- Add one new feature WITHOUT looking anything up first
- Build it, break it, fix it

**Level 3: Explanation Test (5 min)**
- Pretend you're teaching someone
- Explain every line of code out loud
- If you can't explain it, you don't know it yet

**Level 4: Modification Challenge (15 min)**
- Take old project
- Make it do something different
- Change inputs, outputs, or logic

## 🔄 Multiple Concepts at Once

### **Staggered Learning:**

You'll be learning NEW concepts while reviewing OLD ones.

**This is NORMAL and GOOD:**

```
Week 1:
├─ Day 1: Learn Variables (NEW)
├─ Day 2: Review Variables (1-day)
├─ Day 3: Learn Strings (NEW)
├─ Day 4: Review Strings (1-day)
├─ Day 5: Learn If/Else (NEW)

Week 2:
├─ Day 8: Review Variables (7-day) + Learn Loops (NEW)
├─ Day 9: Review Loops (1-day)
├─ Day 10: Review Strings (7-day)
├─ Day 12: Review If/Else (7-day)

Week 3:
├─ Day 17: Review Variables (16-day)
├─ Day 18: Review Loops (7-day)
├─ Day 19: Review Strings (16-day)
```

**Pro tip:** You'll have multiple reviews on some days. That's perfect!

## 📈 Measuring Retention

### **Test Yourself:**

**After Day 2 Review:**
- [ ] Can I explain what this code does?
- [ ] Can I add a feature without Googling?
- [ ] Do I remember why I wrote it this way?

**After Day 8 Review:**
- [ ] Can I rebuild this from scratch?
- [ ] Can I use this concept in a different context?
- [ ] Do I understand the WHY, not just the HOW?

**After Day 17 Review:**
- [ ] Can I combine this with other concepts?
- [ ] Can I solve new problems using this?
- [ ] Could I help someone else learn this?

**After Day 36 Review:**
- [ ] Is this concept "automatic" now?
- [ ] Can I use it without thinking hard?
- [ ] Has it become part of my programming vocabulary?

## 🚨 When Reviews Feel Hard

### **If You Struggle on Day 8:**

**This is NORMAL!**
- You're supposed to struggle a bit
- That struggle is strengthening the memory
- It means you're reviewing at the perfect time

**What to do:**
1. Try for 10 minutes from memory
2. Look up what you need
3. Rebuild it
4. Schedule an extra review in 3 days

### **If You Struggle on Day 17:**

**Possible reasons:**
- Didn't review on Day 8 (inconsistent practice)
- Didn't build enough on Day 1 (weak initial encoding)
- Concept was too complex (need to break it down)

**What to do:**
1. Go back to Day 1 project
2. Rebuild it completely
3. Reset the schedule: Today = new Day 1
4. Don't skip Day 8 this time!

### **If Day 36 Feels Easy:**

**This is GREAT!**
- The concept is now in long-term memory
- You successfully learned it
- You can reduce review frequency

**What to do:**
- Schedule occasional refreshers (every 2-3 months)
- Use this concept in new projects
- Help someone else learn it (solidifies your knowledge)

## 🎯 Your Personal Review Calendar

### **Set Up in 5 Minutes:**

**Option 1: Physical Calendar**
- Print monthly calendar
- When you learn something, mark Day 1
- Count forward: +1, +7, +16, +35
- Mark those dates in different color
- Check daily for review tasks

**Option 2: Digital Calendar (Google/Apple)**
- Create calendar event when learning
- Title: "Review: [Concept Name]"
- Set reminders: 1 day, 7 days, 16 days, 35 days
- When notification hits: do the review

**Option 3: Simple Text File**
```
review_schedule.txt:

Variables: Day 1 = 12/08
- Day 2:  12/09 ✓
- Day 8:  12/15 ✓
- Day 17: 12/24 [pending]
- Day 36: 01/12 [pending]

Strings: Day 1 = 12/10
- Day 2:  12/11 ✓
- Day 8:  12/17 [today!]
- Day 17: 12/26 [pending]
- Day 36: 01/14 [pending]
```

## 💪 Making It Stick

### **The Review Mindset:**

**DON'T think:**
- "Ugh, I have to review this again"
- "I should remember this by now"
- "Reviews are boring"

**DO think:**
- "Reviews are making this permanent"
- "Each review strengthens my memory"
- "10 minutes now saves hours later"

### **Make Reviews Interesting:**

**Day 2:** Add fun feature (e.g., make calculator insult bad math)
**Day 8:** Rebuild in a different way (different variable names, logic)
**Day 17:** Combine with new concepts (make it more powerful)
**Day 36:** Teach it to someone (ultimate test)

## 🔥 Advanced: The Leitner System

### **For Those Who Want Maximum Efficiency:**

Organize your projects into "boxes":

**Box 1:** Review every 1 day (NEW concepts)
**Box 2:** Review every 7 days (LEARNING concepts)
**Box 3:** Review every 16 days (FAMILIAR concepts)
**Box 4:** Review every 35 days (MASTERED concepts)
**Box 5:** Review every 3 months (AUTOMATIC concepts)

**How it works:**
1. New concept starts in Box 1
2. Successful review? Move to next box
3. Failed review? Move back to Box 1
4. This adapts to YOUR learning speed

---

## 📊 Track Your Progress

### **Weekly Review Completion Rate:**

**Track this each week:**
```
Week of 12/08:
Scheduled reviews: 8
Completed reviews: 7
Completion rate: 87% ✓

Week of 12/15:
Scheduled reviews: 12
Completed reviews: 10
Completion rate: 83% ✓
```

**Goal:** 80%+ completion rate
- 100% is ideal but unrealistic
- 80%+ is excellent
- Below 70%? Reduce your learning pace

---

## 🎯 Start Today

### **Your First Review Schedule:**

**Right now:**
1. Look at what you learned in the last week
2. Set up Day 8 reviews for concepts from 7 days ago
3. Set up Day 2 reviews for concepts from yesterday
4. Put reminders in your calendar

**Tomorrow:**
1. Do your 24-hour reviews (quick!)
2. Learn something new
3. Set up its review schedule
4. Repeat daily

---

## 💡 Key Principles

1. **Consistency beats intensity** - 5 min every day > 1 hour once a week
2. **Struggle is good** - If reviews feel easy, you're doing them too often
3. **Adapt the system** - If Day 8 is too soon, try Day 10 instead
4. **Never skip Day 2** - The 24-hour review is the most critical
5. **Reviews aren't optional** - They're where the learning becomes permanent

---

## 🚀 Remember:

> "You don't forget because you're bad at learning.
> You forget because you're not reviewing at the right times."

**This schedule is your weapon against the forgetting curve.**

Use it. Your future self will thank you.
