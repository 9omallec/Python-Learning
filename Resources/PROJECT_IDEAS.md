## Tips for Building Projects

1. **Start simple** - Get basic version working first
2. **Add features one at a time** - Test after each addition
3. **Use comments** - Explain what each section does
4. **Save versions** - Copy the file before making big changes
5. **Break it down** - Use functions to organize code
6. **Test with bad input** - What if user types something wrong?
7. **Make it your own** - Add unique features!

**Remember:** Projects are where real learning happens. Don't worry about making them perfect - just make them work!
