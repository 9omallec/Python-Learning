## 💡 What This Means For You

### **OLD Approach (What Doesn't Work):**
1. Study syntax for weeks ❌
2. Memorize functions ❌
3. Do abstract exercises ❌
4. Finally build something ❌
5. Result: Months before first project ❌

### **NEW Approach (What Works):**
1. Learn concept (5 min) ✅
2. Build project immediately (25 min) ✅
3. Look up syntax as needed ✅
4. Review at optimal intervals ✅
5. Result: Day 1 = Working project ✅

## 💬 Questions?

**"Should I still do the lessons?"**
- Yes, but differently! Read lesson (5 min) → build project immediately (25 min)

**"What about the practice.py files?"**
- Do them! But time-box: 20 min, then move on. Building projects matters more.

**"Should I memorize anything?"**
- NO! Use SYNTAX_REFERENCE.md for lookups. You'll remember through building.

**"How many projects should I build?"**
- Goal: 30 projects in 30 days. Quantity > quality at first.

**"I'm stuck, what do I do?"**
- Struggle for 15 min → Take 5 min break → Try 15 more min → Look it up
- Getting stuck = learning!
