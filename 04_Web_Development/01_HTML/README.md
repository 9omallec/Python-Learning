# HTML - Structure of the Web

**Start Here**: Learn the foundation of every website.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the skeleton of every webpage. It defines the **structure** and **content**, but not the appearance (that's CSS) or behavior (that's JavaScript).

**By the end, you'll be able to:**
- Create well-structured web pages
- Use semantic HTML for accessibility
- Build forms, tables, and lists
- Understand how HTML works with CSS and JavaScript

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Tags and Elements
```html
<tagname>Content</tagname>
```
- Opening tag: `<p>`
- Closing tag: `</p>`
- Self-closing: `<img />` or `<br />`

### Attributes
```html
<a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">Link</a>
```
- `href` and `target` are attributes
- Provide extra information about elements

### Semantic HTML
Use tags that describe their content:
- ❌ Bad: `<div>Header</div>`
- ✅ Good: `<header>Header content</header>`

**Why?** Accessibility, SEO, and code readability.

## 💡 How to Practice

### 1. Open Files in Browser
**Option A: Direct Open**
- Right-click lesson.html or practice.html
- Choose "Open with" → Your browser

**Option B: Live Server (Recommended)**
- Install "Live Server" extension in VS Code
- Right-click HTML file → "Open with Live Server"
- Auto-refreshes when you save changes!

## 🎨 Don't Worry About Appearance

**Your HTML will look ugly!** That's completely normal and expected.

HTML = **Structure**
CSS = **Style** (you'll learn this next week)

**For now:**
- Focus on getting the structure right
- Use semantic tags appropriately
- Don't worry about colors, fonts, spacing
- Ugly but well-structured > pretty but broken

---

## ✅ How to Know You're Ready for CSS

You should be comfortable:
- Writing HTML from scratch (not copy-paste)
- Using semantic tags appropriately
- Creating forms and tables
- Understanding attributes (href, src, alt, etc.)
- Reading HTML and understanding its structure

**You don't need to memorize every tag!** Just understand the common ones and know how to look up others.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

After completing HTML basics (1 week), move to:
- **CSS** - Make it look good
- **JavaScript** - Make it interactive
- **Flask** - Connect to Python backend

## 📝 Notes

**Using AI/Google:**
- Totally fine and encouraged!
- "How do I create a table in HTML?"
- "HTML form input types"
- The skill is knowing WHAT to search for

**Common Mistakes:**
- Forgetting closing tags
- Nesting tags incorrectly
- Wrong attribute names
- That's all normal - you'll learn by doing!

**Remember:**
- HTML is forgiving (won't crash like Python)
- You can't break your computer
- Experiment freely!

**Start with lesson.html, then practice.html, then W3Schools!**
