## 📍 Current Status

**You already have coding challenges here:**
- `01_Python_Fundamentals/Current/11_Coding_Challenges/`

**That's where you should practice for now!**

You've already completed:
- ✅ FizzBuzz (solved independently!)

Still to do:
- [ ] 4-7 more challenges from that file

## 🚀 When Will This Be Populated?

After you:
1. Complete all Python fundamentals (Lessons 1-13)
2. Finish all Lesson 11 coding challenges
3. Start preparing for interviews or want more practice

**For now:** All your coding practice is in the `Current/` folder under Lesson 11.

## 💡 Why Keep This Separate?

The `11_Coding_Challenges` folder is part of learning fundamentals.

**This folder (05_Coding_Practice) will be for:**
- Interview prep specifically
- Practicing after you know all the concepts
- Harder challenges that combine multiple concepts
- Timed practice sessions
- LeetCode-style problems

**Don't worry about this folder yet!**

Focus on: `01_Python_Fundamentals/Current/11_Coding_Challenges/`
