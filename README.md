## 📈 Learning Tips

### Do's:
✅ **Practice daily** - Even 30 minutes is better than 3 hours once a week
✅ **Type code yourself** - Don't copy/paste, build muscle memory
✅ **Make mistakes** - Errors are learning opportunities
✅ **Review regularly** - Go back to earlier lessons
✅ **Build projects** - Apply what you learn
✅ **Track progress** - Update the progress tracker

### Don'ts:
❌ **Don't rush** - Understanding beats speed
❌ **Don't skip exercises** - They build on each other
❌ **Don't memorize** - Focus on understanding
❌ **Don't compare** - Everyone learns at their own pace
❌ **Don't give up** - Programming is hard at first, then it clicks
