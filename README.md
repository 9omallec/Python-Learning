## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Daily Routine
1. **Review (10 min)** - Redo 2-3 exercises from a previous lesson
2. **New Material (20 min)** - Work on current lesson
3. **Practice** - Do the practice.py exercises
4. **Extra (optional)** - Try extra_practice.py or start a project

### Testing Code
**Best method:**
1. Highlight code in practice file
2. Press `Shift + Enter`
3. Only that code runs!

**Or use:** `Sandbox/scratch.py` for quick tests

### Tracking Progress
Update `Resources/PROGRESS.md` as you complete lessons

## 💡 Learning Tips

1. **Don't rush** - Understanding > Speed
2. **Type, don't copy** - Build muscle memory
3. **Practice daily** - 20 min/day > 3 hours/week
4. **Review often** - Come back to old lessons
5. **Build projects** - That's where real learning happens
6. **Read errors** - They're trying to help you!
7. **Ask for hints** - Don't look at answers immediately

## 🔧 Useful Commands

### Running Python
```bash
python filename.py
python Sandbox/scratch.py
python Practice/07A_Basic_For_Loops/practice.py
```

### VSCode Shortcuts
- `Shift + Enter` - Run selected code
- `Ctrl + /` - Comment/uncomment
- `Ctrl + S` - Save
- **Ctrl + `** - Terminal
- `Ctrl + F5` - Run file

## 🎓 Next Steps

After completing Lessons 1-10:
1. Build 3-5 portfolio projects
2. Learn Git/GitHub
3. Choose specialization
4. Learn complementary skills (SQL, HTML/CSS, etc.)
5. Build more complex projects
6. Start applying for jobs!

**Timeline:** 6-12 months to job-ready (with consistent practice)

**Remember:** You're not just learning Python - you're learning how to think like a programmer!

Keep going, Connor! 🚀
