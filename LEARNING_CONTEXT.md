# Learning Context for Claude

**Student:** Connor (GitHub: 9omallec)
**Started:** November 18, 2025
**Current Status:** RESTARTING from Lesson 1 with Build-First Method
**Last Updated:** December 8, 2025
**Major Update:** Complete system restructure based on 2025 research

---

## Overview

Connor is learning Python with goal of becoming job-ready. On December 8, 2025, the entire learning system was restructured based on 2025 cognitive science research and the "build-first" methodology. Connor decided to RESTART from Lesson 1 using this new, research-backed approach.

---

## 🚨 MAJOR UPDATE (Dec 8, 2025)

### What Changed:
Complete system restructure based on 2025 research showing:
- **84% of successful students** learn through building projects, NOT memorizing syntax
- **30-50% better retention** with spaced repetition (Days 1, 7, 16, 35)
- **25-40% improvement** with active recall testing
- **Build-first beats read-first** for programming education

### New System Files Created (65+ files):
1. **Master Resources:** LEARNING_OPTIMIZATION.md, BUILD_FIRST_METHOD.md, REVIEW_SCHEDULE.md, DELIBERATE_PRACTICE.md, SYNTAX_REFERENCE.md, PROJECT_CHALLENGES.md
2. **Per Lesson (Lessons 1-7B):** ACTIVE_RECALL.md, BUILD_PROJECTS.md, LESSON_GUIDE.md
3. **Tracking:** MY_BUILDS_TRACKER.md
4. **Guides:** START_HERE_NEW.md, WHATS_NEW_2025.md, RESTRUCTURE_COMPLETE.md

### New Learning Approach (Build-First Method):

**OLD (What we did before):**
```
Read lesson → Do exercises → Hope it sticks
```

**NEW (Research-backed):**
```
Micro-lesson (5 min) → Build project (20 min) → Build more (60 min) → Active recall test (10 min) → Review strategically (Days 1, 7, 16, 35)
```

### Key Principles (Updated):
1. **Build First, Always** - 80% building, 20% learning
2. **Syntax is Lookup, Not Memory** - Use SYNTAX_REFERENCE.md
3. **Active Recall Works** - Test yourself, don't re-read
4. **Spaced Repetition** - Review Days 1, 7, 16, 35
5. **Getting Stuck = Learning** - Struggle 15 min before looking up
6. **Track Everything** - MY_BUILDS_TRACKER.md
7. **Quantity > Quality** - 100 messy projects > 10 perfect ones

### New File Structure Per Lesson:
- **LESSON_GUIDE.md** - Build-first roadmap (main file to start)
- **BUILD_PROJECTS.md** - 7-10 immediate projects to build
- **ACTIVE_RECALL.md** - Self-testing flashcards
- `lesson.py` - Still available for reference
- `practice.py` - Now optional (projects teach more)
- `extra_practice.py` - Optional advanced work

## How Connor Works with Claude

### Typical Session Flow
1. **Start with context:** "I'm working on Lesson X" or "I want to practice Y"
2. **Ask for exercises:** Request practice problems at appropriate difficulty
3. **Get hints, not answers:** Ask for guidance when stuck
4. **Review solutions:** Discuss approaches after attempting problems
5. **Build understanding:** Ask "why" questions about concepts

### Preferred Learning Style
- Prefers to struggle a bit before getting hints
- Wants explanations that connect to real-world use cases
- Likes breaking down complex problems into smaller steps
- Values understanding error messages and debugging strategies

### Code Testing Method
**Primary method:** Highlight code in VSCode → `Shift + Enter` to run selection
**Alternative:** Use `#Sandbox/scratch.py` for quick tests

---

## Important Context for Future Sessions

### What Connor Knows
- Basic Python syntax (print, variables, math, input, strings)
- Conditional logic (if/else)
- Basic for loops
- Currently learning while loops

### What Connor is Building Toward
- **Short term:** Complete lessons 1-10
- **Medium term:** Build 3-5 portfolio projects
- **Long term:** Job-ready Python developer (6-12 months)

### Future Specialization Options
After completing fundamentals (lessons 1-10):
- Web Development (Flask/Django)
- Data Science (pandas/numpy)
- Automation/Scripting
- General Software Development

## Teaching Guidelines for Claude

### When Creating Exercises
1. Match difficulty to current lesson level
2. Build on previously learned concepts
3. Include a mix of easier and harder problems
4. Provide real-world context when possible
5. Encourage experimentation

### When Explaining Concepts
1. Start with simple examples
2. Build up to more complex applications
3. Connect to real programming scenarios
4. Explain the "why" not just the "how"
5. Anticipate common mistakes

### When Connor Gets Stuck
1. First, ask what they've tried
2. Provide hints, not full solutions
3. Guide toward understanding, not just working code
4. Help interpret error messages
5. Encourage testing and experimentation

### Code Review Approach
- Point out both what works and what could improve
- Explain why certain approaches are better
- Teach best practices naturally through feedback
- Celebrate progress and good thinking

## Practical Tips

### Running Python Files
```bash
python filename.py
python Practice/07B_While_Loops/practice.py
python #Sandbox/scratch.py
```

### Updating Progress
Connor tracks progress in `Resources/PROGRESS.md` - remind to update after completing lessons

### Project Ideas
After Lesson 6, encourage starting mini projects from `Resources/PROJECT_IDEAS.md`

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### When Connor Makes Common Mistakes
Reference `Resources/COMMON_MISTAKES.md` to see if it's a known pattern

### When Choosing Project Difficulty
Refer to `Resources/PROJECT_IDEAS.md` which has projects organized by skill level

### When Debugging
Encourage using error messages as learning tools - they tell you what's wrong and where

---

## Session Continuity

When starting a new session:
1. Ask what Connor is currently working on
2. Check `Resources/PROGRESS.md` if needed for status
3. Review recent work in the relevant Practice folder
4. Continue building on established patterns

Remember: Connor has a solid foundation in basics and is now building toward intermediate concepts with loops. Keep exercises practical and applicable to real programming scenarios.

**Note:** This context file helps maintain continuity across different devices and sessions. Update it as progress is made and new patterns emerge.
