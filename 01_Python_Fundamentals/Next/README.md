# Coming Soon: Advanced Python Fundamentals

**These lessons will be created when you're ready for them** (after completing Lessons 10-11)

---

## 📚 Upcoming Lessons

### Lesson 12: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics
**What you'll learn:**
- Classes and objects
- Methods and attributes
- `__init__` constructor
- Instance vs class variables
- Basic inheritance
- Why OOP matters for larger projects

**Why this matters:**
- Organize complex code better
- Build reusable components
- Understand most Python libraries (they use classes)
- Essential for Flask, Django, and most frameworks

**Example use case:**
- Create a `Pokemon` class for your Pokedex
- Build a `WeatherData` class for your weather app
- Make a `Todo` class for todo apps

---

### Lesson 13: File I/O (Input/Output)
**What you'll learn:**
- Reading text files (`with open()`)
- Writing to files
- Appending to existing files
- Working with CSV files
- JSON file handling
- File paths and directories

**Why this matters:**
- Save user data between sessions
- Read configuration files
- Import/export data
- Build data processing tools
- Essential for most real applications

**Example use case:**
- Save favorite Pokemon to a file
- Export weather history to CSV
- Store app settings in JSON
- Create a notes app that persists data

---

## 🎯 When Will These Be Created?

**After you complete:**
- ✅ Lesson 10: Dictionaries
- ✅ Lesson 11: Coding Challenges (at least 5-6 challenges)

**Then:**
I'll create these lessons with the same structure:
- `lesson.py` - Concepts and examples
- `practice.py` - Exercises with guidance
- Clear, practical examples you can use

---

## 🚀 For Now

Focus on:
1. **Lesson 10** - Dictionaries (Current folder)
2. **Lesson 11** - Coding Challenges (Current folder)

These two lessons will round out your Python fundamentals before moving to OOP and File I/O.

**Don't worry about these yet!** Complete what's in the `Current/` folder first.
