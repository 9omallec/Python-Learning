## Tips:

- Don't try to memorize all of these at once!
- Focus on the "Most Important Ones" first
- Use shortcuts naturally as you code
- The more you use them, the more they become muscle memory
- You can always use the mouse instead - shortcuts just make you faster

## Finding More Shortcuts:

Press `Ctrl + K` then `Ctrl + S` to open the full keyboard shortcuts menu in VSCode.

**Pro Tip:** Start with just saving (`Ctrl + S`) and opening the terminal (**Ctrl + `**). Add more shortcuts as you get comfortable!
