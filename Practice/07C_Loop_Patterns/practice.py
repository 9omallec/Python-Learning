# ===================================

# Practice 1: Print each letter in your name on a separate line


# Practice 2: Calculate the sum of numbers 1 to 20


# Practice 3: Count how many vowels are in the word "programming"


# Practice 4: Build a string of 10 X's using a loop (XXXXXXXXXX)


# Practice 5: Ask user for 5 numbers, find and print the largest one


# Practice 6: Ask user for 3 numbers, calculate and print their average


# Practice 7: Print all numbers from 1 to 20, but skip multiples of 3


# Practice 8: Count how many times the letter 'e' appears in "hello everyone"


# Practice 9: Print this pattern using a loop:

# *****


# Practice 10: Ask user for a word, print it in reverse


# Challenge 1: Create a multiplication quiz
# Ask user to answer 5 multiplication problems (like "What is 3 x 4?")
# Keep track of how many they got correct
# Print their score at the end


# Challenge 2: Calculate factorial
# Ask user for a number, calculate its factorial
# Factorial of 5 = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120
