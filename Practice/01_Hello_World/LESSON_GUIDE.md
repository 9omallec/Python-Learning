# Lesson 1: Print Statements (Build-First Approach)

**Total time: 45 minutes**

---

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
- Display text and numbers on screen
- Format output nicely
- Build simple programs using print()

**Most importantly:** You'll BUILD 3-5 working programs today!

---

## 📚 The Build-First Method

**OLD way (don't do this):**
1. Read all about print() for 30 min
2. Memorize syntax
3. Do exercises
4. Maybe build something

**NEW way (do this):**
1. Learn just enough to start (5 min)
2. Build project immediately (15 min)
3. Learn more as you need it
4. Repeat!

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Micro-Lesson (5 minutes)

### The Basics:

**Print text:**
```python
print("Hello World")
```

**Print numbers:**
```python
print(42)
```

**Print multiple things:**
```python
print("Name:", "Connor", "Age:", 35)
```

**That's enough to start!** Close this file and build your first project.

---

## 🛠️ Step 2: Build Your First Project (15 minutes)

**Open:** [BUILD_PROJECTS.md](BUILD_PROJECTS.md)

**Build:** Project 1 - Personal Introduction Card

**Rules:**
- Close this file
- Build from scratch
- Get stuck? Struggle 10 min first
- Then look up what you need

**GO BUILD IT NOW!**

---

## 🔄 Step 3: Learn More (As Needed)

**Come back here ONLY if you're stuck and tried for 10+ min**

### More Print Features:

**New lines:**
```python
print("Line 1\nLine 2")
```

**Tabs:**
```python
print("Name:\tConnor")
```

**Multiple prints:**
```python
print("First")
print("Second")  # Automatic new line
```

**Common Errors:**

```python
# WRONG - Missing quotes
print(Hello)

# RIGHT
print("Hello")
```

```python
# WRONG - Mismatched quotes
print("Hello')

# RIGHT
print("Hello")
```

**Now go back to building!**

---

## 🛠️ Step 4: Build More Projects (40 minutes)

**From:** [BUILD_PROJECTS.md](BUILD_PROJECTS.md)

**Build:**
- Project 2: Daily Schedule (15 min)
- Project 3: Simple Story (15 min)
- Project 4 or 5: Your choice (15 min)

**Goal:** Have 4 working programs by end of lesson

---

## 🧠 Step 5: Active Recall (10 minutes)

**Open:** [ACTIVE_RECALL.md](ACTIVE_RECALL.md)

**Test yourself:**
- Answer cards WITHOUT looking at answers first
- Check your answers
- Identify what you forgot

**This is important!** Active recall = 25-40% better retention

---

## 📋 Step 6: Practice Exercises (Optional)

**If you have extra time:**

**Open:** [practice.py](practice.py)

**Do:** As many exercises as you want (but don't spend more than 20 min)

**Note:** Projects teach you more than exercises, so prioritize building!

---

## ✅ Lesson Complete When:

- [ ] Built at least 3 projects
- [ ] Completed Active Recall cards
- [ ] Can use print() without looking it up
- [ ] Understand quotes for text, no quotes for numbers

**Time invested:** 45-60 minutes
**Projects built:** 3-5
**Concepts mastered:** print(), basic formatting

---

## 🔄 Review Schedule

**Follow spaced repetition for maximum retention:**

- **Tomorrow (Day 2):** Review your projects, add one feature to each
- **Next week (Day 8):** Rebuild one project from memory
- **2 weeks (Day 17):** Use print() in a more complex project
- **1 month (Day 36):** Quick review - should feel automatic now

**See:** [REVIEW_SCHEDULE.md](../../Resources/REVIEW_SCHEDULE.md)

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

**You're ready for Lesson 2 when:**
- You've built 3+ print-based programs
- You can format output nicely
- You're comfortable with the build-first approach

**Move to:** [Practice/02_Variables/LESSON_GUIDE.md](../02_Variables/LESSON_GUIDE.md)

## 💡 Tips for Success

**DO:**
- ✅ Build immediately after learning
- ✅ Get stuck and struggle (it's learning!)
- ✅ Make messy projects (perfect comes later)
- ✅ Use SYNTAX_REFERENCE.md for lookups
- ✅ Track your builds

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Read for hours before building
- ❌ Try to memorize everything
- ❌ Skip the projects
- ❌ Aim for perfection on first try
- ❌ Compare your code to others

---

**Remember:** You learn by BUILDING, not by reading about building!

**Stop reading. Start building. Right now!** 🚀
