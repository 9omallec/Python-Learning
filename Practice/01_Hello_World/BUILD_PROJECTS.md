# Build Projects: Print Statements

**Learn by building, not by reading**

---

## 🎯 How to Use This

1. **Read the project goal**
2. **Close this file**
3. **Build it from scratch**
4. **Get stuck?** Struggle 10 min, then look up syntax
5. **Finish it** (messy is fine!)
6. **Move to next project**

**Time per project:** 10-15 minutes
