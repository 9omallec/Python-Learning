## How to Use

1. Start with lesson 01
2. **Read and run** the `lesson.py` file
3. **Complete** the `practice.py` exercises
4. **Repeat** each lesson until comfortable
5. **Reference** the [QUICK_REFERENCE.md](QUICK_REFERENCE.md) cheat sheet

## Learning Tips

- Don't rush! Take time to understand each concept
- Practice is more important than speed
- Make mistakes - that's how you learn
- Retype code from lessons (don't just copy/paste)
- Come back and practice again tomorrow
- Syntax memorization comes with repetition

## Running Python Code in VSCode
