# EXTRA PRACTICE: Variables
# ===================================

# Exercise 1: Create variables for all your family members' names
# Print them all
mom = "Janet"
dad = "Mark"
sister = "Hannah"
brother = "Mason"
print(mom, dad, sister, brother)

# Exercise 2: Create variables for item prices, calculate total
# Example: apple = 1.50, banana = 0.75, orange = 1.25
water = 1.5
sausage = 5
candy = 3
print(water + sausage + candy)

# Exercise 3: Store your birth year in a variable
# Calculate and print your age (use 2025 as current year)
birth_year = 1990
print(2025 - birth_year)

# Exercise 4: Create a variable for temperature in Fahrenheit (like 75)
# Store it, print it, then change it to a different value and print again
temp = 25
print(temp)
temp = 35
print(temp)

# Exercise 5: Create variables for length and width of a room
# Store them, then create a third variable for area (length * width)
length = 10
width = 15
area = length * width
print(area)

# Exercise 6: Create a boolean variable for each:
# - Is it raining? (True or False)
# - Is it sunny? (True or False)
# - Is it cold? (True or False)
# Print them all
is_it_raining = False
is_it_sunny = True
is_it_cold = True
print(is_it_raining, is_it_cold, is_it_sunny)

# Exercise 7: Create variables for your favorite:

# - Year it came out (integer)
# - Rating out of 10 (float)
# - Would you watch it again? (boolean)
# Print them all
movie = "Princess Mononoke"
year = 1992
rating = 10.0
rewatch = True
print(movie, year, rating, rewatch)

# Exercise 8: Store the same number in three different variables
# Add 10 to the first, multiply the second by 2, subtract 5 from the third
# Print all three results
a = 2
b = 2
c = 2
print(a + 10)
print(b * 2)
print(c - 5)

# Exercise 9: Create a variable for your hourly wage
# Create a variable for hours worked
# Calculate and print your total pay
wage = 26.50
hours = 40
print(wage * hours)
