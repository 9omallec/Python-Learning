# Lesson 2: Variables (Build-First Approach)

**Total time: 60 minutes**

---

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
- Store data in variables
- Use different data types (int, float, str, bool)
- Perform calculations with variables
- Update and reuse variables
- Build useful programs that remember information

**Most importantly:** You'll BUILD 4-5 working programs today!

## 🚀 Step 1: Micro-Lesson (5 minutes)

### The Basics:

**Create a variable:**
```python
name = "Connor"
age = 35
price = 19.99
```

**Use a variable:**
```python
print(name)
print(age)
print(f"I am {age} years old")  # f-string
```

**Update a variable:**
```python
score = 0
score = score + 10  # Now score is 10
score += 5          # Shorthand, now score is 15
```

**That's enough!** Close this file and build your first project.

---

## 🛠️ Step 2: Build Your First Project (20 minutes)

**Open:** [BUILD_PROJECTS.md](BUILD_PROJECTS.md)

**Build:** Project 1 - Personal Info Card

**Rules:**
- Close this file
- Build from scratch
- Struggle for 10-15 min if stuck
- Then use [SYNTAX_REFERENCE.md](../../Resources/SYNTAX_REFERENCE.md) if needed

**GO BUILD NOW!**

## 🔄 Step 3: Learn More (As Needed)

**Come back ONLY if stuck after trying 10+ min**

### Data Types:

```python
age = 35              # int (whole number)
price = 19.99         # float (decimal)
name = "Connor"       # str (string/text)
is_student = True     # bool (True/False)
```

### Math with Variables:

```python
x = 10
y = 3

print(x + y)    # 13 (addition)
print(x - y)    # 7 (subtraction)
print(x * y)    # 30 (multiplication)
print(x / y)    # 3.333... (division)
print(x // y)   # 3 (integer division)
print(x % y)    # 1 (remainder/modulo)
print(x ** y)   # 1000 (exponent/power)
```

### F-Strings (Best way to print variables):

```python
name = "Connor"
age = 35
print(f"Hi, I'm {name} and I'm {age}")
```

### Common Errors:

```python
# WRONG - Missing quotes for text
name = Connor

# RIGHT
name = "Connor"
```

```python
# WRONG - Can't start with number
2nd_place = "Silver"

# RIGHT
second_place = "Silver"
```

**Now go back to building!**

## 🛠️ Step 4: Build More Projects (50 minutes)

**From:** [BUILD_PROJECTS.md](BUILD_PROJECTS.md)

**Build at least 3 more:**
- Project 2: Simple Calculator (15 min)
- Project 3: Shopping Cart Total (20 min)
- Project 4 or 5: Your choice (20 min)

**Goal:** Have 4-5 working programs by end of lesson

---

## 🧠 Step 5: Active Recall (10 minutes)

**Open:** [ACTIVE_RECALL.md](ACTIVE_RECALL.md)

**Test yourself:**
- Try to answer WITHOUT looking first
- Check your answers
- Note what you forgot

**This step is crucial!** Testing = 25-40% better retention

---

## 📋 Step 6: Practice Exercises (Optional)

**If you have time:**

**Open:** [practice.py](practice.py)

**Do:** Some exercises (20 min max)

**Remember:** Projects > Exercises for learning!

---

## ✅ Lesson Complete When:

- [ ] Built at least 4 projects using variables
- [ ] Completed Active Recall cards
- [ ] Comfortable creating and using variables
- [ ] Can do math with variables
- [ ] Can use f-strings to print variables
- [ ] Understand int, float, str, bool

**Time invested:** 60-75 minutes
**Projects built:** 4-5
**Concepts mastered:** Variables, data types, basic math

---

## 🔄 Review Schedule

**Spaced repetition for long-term retention:**

- **Tomorrow (Day 2):** Open yesterday's projects, add one feature to each
- **Next week (Day 8):** Rebuild one calculator project from memory
- **2 weeks (Day 17):** Use variables in a more complex project
- **1 month (Day 36):** Quick review - should be automatic

**See:** [REVIEW_SCHEDULE.md](../../Resources/REVIEW_SCHEDULE.md)

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

**Ready for Lesson 3 when:**
- You've built 4+ projects with variables
- You can create, use, and update variables
- You understand different data types
- You're comfortable with f-strings

**Move to:** [Practice/03_Math_Operations/LESSON_GUIDE.md](../03_Math_Operations/LESSON_GUIDE.md)

## 💡 Tips for Success

**DO:**
- ✅ Build calculators and real tools
- ✅ Use f-strings (not old-style concatenation)
- ✅ Name variables clearly (total_price, not tp)
- ✅ Track your builds
- ✅ Experiment with different data types

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Try to memorize all operators
- ❌ Skip building projects
- ❌ Use confusing variable names (x1, x2, x3)
- ❌ Spend hours reading before building
- ❌ Aim for perfect code on first try

**You now know how to store and reuse information - that's HUGE!** 🚀

**Stop reading. Build something. Now!**
