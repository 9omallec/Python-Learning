# PRACTICE: Math Operations
# ===================================

# Practice 1: Create two numbers and add them
x = 1
y = 2
print(x + y)

# Practice 2: Multiply 7 by 8
print(7 * 8)

# Practice 3: Divide 100 by 3 (regular division)
print(100 / 3)

# Practice 4: Divide 100 by 3 (integer division)
print (100 // 3)

# Practice 5: Find the remainder when 17 is divided by 5
print( 17 % 5)

# Practice 6: Calculate 2 to the power of 10
print(2 ** 10)

# Practice 7: Create variables for length and width, calculate area
length = 5
width = 10
print(length * width)

# Practice 8: Calculate the total cost of 5 items at $3.99 each
print(3.99 * 5)

# Practice 9: Use += to add 10 to a variable
width += 10
print(width)

# Challenge: Calculate the average of three numbers (add them and divide by 3)
print((3 + 4 + 5) / 3)
