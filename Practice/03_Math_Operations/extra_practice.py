# Exercise 1: Calculate the area of a circle with radius 5
# Formula: area = 3.14 * radius * radius


# Exercise 2: Convert 100 degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius
# Formula: C = (F - 32) * 5/9


# Exercise 3: You have $100. You buy 3 items at $12.50 each
# Calculate how much money you have left


# Exercise 4: Calculate compound interest
# Start with $1000, 5% interest rate, after 1 year
# Formula: final = principal * (1 + rate)


# Exercise 5: Calculate the perimeter of a rectangle
# Length = 10, Width = 5


# Exercise 6: Split a restaurant bill
# Total bill: $87.50
# Number of people: 4
# Include 20% tip
# How much does each person pay?


# Exercise 7: Calculate your age in days

# Exercise 8: Calculate the average of five numbers: 78, 92, 85, 88, 95


# Exercise 9: You're saving money. You have $50 and save $20 per week
# How much will you have after 10 weeks?
# Use += in a calculation


# Exercise 10: Calculate the volume of a box
# Length = 5, Width = 3, Height = 2
# Volume = length * width * height


# Exercise 11: You run 3 miles per day. How many miles in a year?


# Exercise 12: Calculate sales tax
# Item costs $49.99, tax rate is 8% (0.08)
# What's the total price with tax?


# Challenge: Calculate BMI (Body Mass Index)
# BMI = weight_in_kg / (height_in_meters ** 2)
# Use weight = 70kg, height = 1.75m
