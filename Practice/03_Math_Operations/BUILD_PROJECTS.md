## Project 1: Basic Calculator (15 min)

**Goal:** Create a calculator that performs all operations

**Requirements:**
- Two number variables
- Perform all 6 operations (+, -, *, /, //, %, **)
- Print each result with a label
- Make output clear and organized

**Example Output:**
```
====== CALCULATOR ======
Numbers: 25 and 4

Addition: 25 + 4 = 29
Subtraction: 25 - 4 = 21
Multiplication: 25 * 4 = 100
Division: 25 / 4 = 6.25
Floor Division: 25 // 4 = 6
Modulo: 25 % 4 = 1
Power: 25 ** 4 = 390625
========================
```

**Challenge:** Try with different numbers, including decimals

## Project 2: Restaurant Bill Calculator (20 min)

**Goal:** Calculate total bill with tax and tip

**Requirements:**
- Food cost variable
- Tax rate (e.g., 8%)
- Tip percentage (e.g., 18%)
- Calculate tax amount
- Calculate tip amount (on subtotal, not including tax)
- Calculate total
- Print itemized breakdown

**Example Output:**
```
===== RESTAURANT BILL =====
Food Cost:    $45.00
Tax (8%):     $3.60
Subtotal:     $48.60
Tip (18%):    $8.10
--------------------------
TOTAL:        $56.70
===========================
```

**Challenge:** Calculate per-person cost if splitting between 3 people

## Project 3: Temperature Converter (15 min)

**Goal:** Convert between Fahrenheit and Celsius

**Requirements:**
- Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit: F = (C × 9/5) + 32
- Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius: C = (F - 32) × 5/9
- Do at least 3 conversions each way
- Print results clearly

**Example Output:**
```
==== TEMPERATURE CONVERTER ====
0°C = 32.0°F
25°C = 77.0°F
100°C = 212.0°F

32°F = 0.0°C
77°F = 25.0°C
212°F = 100.0°C
================================
```

**Challenge:** Add Kelvin conversions (K = C + 273.15)

## Project 4: Circle Calculator (20 min)

**Goal:** Calculate circle properties

**Requirements:**
- Radius variable
- Calculate circumference (2πr)
- Calculate area (πr²)
- Calculate diameter (2r)
- Use π = 3.14159
- Try with 3 different radius values

**Example Output:**
```
===== CIRCLE CALCULATOR =====
Radius: 5 units

Diameter: 10.0 units
Circumference: 31.4159 units
Area: 78.53975 square units

=============================
```

**Challenge:** Calculate volume and surface area of a sphere

## Project 5: Time Converter (20 min)

**Goal:** Convert time between different units

**Requirements:**
- Start with a number of hours
- Convert to minutes
- Convert to seconds
- Convert days to hours, minutes, seconds
- Print all conversions

**Example Output:**
```
====== TIME CONVERTER ======
3 hours equals:
- 180 minutes
- 10,800 seconds

5 days equals:
- 120 hours
- 7,200 minutes
- 432,000 seconds
============================
```

**Challenge:** Convert years to days, hours, minutes, seconds

## Project 6: Shopping Discount Calculator (25 min)

**Goal:** Calculate sale prices with multiple discounts

**Requirements:**
- Original price
- First discount (e.g., 20% off)
- Additional discount (e.g., 15% off already discounted price)
- Calculate each discount amount
- Calculate final price
- Calculate total savings

**Example Output:**
```
===== DISCOUNT CALCULATOR =====
Original Price: $100.00

First Discount (20%): -$20.00
Price after 1st discount: $80.00

Second Discount (15%): -$12.00
Final Price: $68.00

Total Savings: $32.00 (32%)
================================
```

**Challenge:** Add tax after discounts

---

## Project 7: Loan Payment Calculator (25 min)

**Goal:** Calculate monthly loan payment

**Requirements:**
- Loan amount (principal)
- Annual interest rate
- Loan term in years
- Calculate monthly payment using formula:
  - M = P × (r(1+r)^n) / ((1+r)^n - 1)
  - Where: P = principal, r = monthly rate, n = number of months
- Show total paid and total interest

**Example Output:**
```
====== LOAN CALCULATOR ======
Loan Amount: $20,000
Interest Rate: 5% per year
Term: 5 years

Monthly Payment: $377.42
Total Paid: $22,645.20
Total Interest: $2,645.20
=============================
```

**Challenge:** Show year-by-year breakdown
